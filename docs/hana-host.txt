The hana-host role

the hana-host role is intended to run on a plain RHEL installation immediately after installing a minimal OS image.
It has the following tasks:

- register RHEL system against Satellite or RHN (tag: system-registration,osprep)
- install all required packages for the defined HANA version (tag: packages,osprep)
- configure/disable system services (tag: services,osprep)
- configure system-tuning (tag:system-tuning,osprep)
- configure SAP compliant hostname scheme (tag: set-hostname,osprep)
- configure disk-partitioning and setup (tag: disk_partitioning) (not fully tested, use with caution)


Variables used for hana-host-role

# Debugging
#----------

You can set debuglevel for debugging with:

debuglevel: 3

Only active when running ansible-playbook with -vvv option. See man-page for details

#  System Registration. 
#-------------------------
# If you have a Satellite 6 Server or RedHat Network Account, define an activation key and you can automatically register the system to the appropriate channel

reg_activation_key: <activation_key>
reg_organization_id: <org_id>

# Set this variable to the DNS name of your satellite server, If unset the RHN is used for registration (Not implemented yet)
# If this variable is set, it downloads the certificate package from Satellite 6 and installs it.
satellite_server: <FQDN>


# If you set force_repo_reset to true it removes all existing repos and readds the necessary correct EUS repositories
# If set to false it adds all necessary EUS repos to the existing, without deleting existing ones
# This is only necessary, if your activation key is not set up properly.
force_repo_reset: [true|false]

# If you use a different setup of repositories and do not use Satellite or RHN set check_repos to false and make sure you have the right repositories configured to your system
check_repos: true


### Configuration for SAP-Media-Check
### ---------------------------------

# This checks if your installation media is available at {{ hana_installdir }}
# Then it reads the configuration and stores it as a fact: hana_version
# The role also mounts the configuration directory if necessary.

# If you have the rar file on an NFS-Share define the following:
# The rest though is optional
# NFS Share that holds the rar files
install_nfs: "10.32.97.3:/public/sap-software"
# directory, where Hana install binaries are needed
installroot: /install
# Hana Install version (RAR Archive Number)
installversion: "51051151"
# unrar command
# RedHat does not provide an unrar command, so that you need to provide it externally
# Some examples, where to get working unrar packages
# RHEL6
#unrar_pkg: http://apt.sw.be/redhat/el6/en/x86_64/rpmforge/RPMS/unrar-4.2.3-1.el6.rf.x86_64.rpm
# RHEL 7:
#unrar_pkg: https://forensics.cert.org/centos/cert/7/x86_64/unrar-5.3.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm 
# I prefer putting it on the server where my archives live 
unrar_cmd: {{ installroot + "/bin/unrar" }}
# If you have a different installation source you can just define
# the following variable, otherwise leave as default
hana_installdir: {{ installroot + "/" + installversion }}



# Time
#----------

#Use this to configure your NTP-Server
ntpserver: ntp.pool.org

# Disk Setup
#------------
# This ansible script is able to configure your additional disks ready for use with hana by defining the follwoing variables
# This can be used to configure /hana/{data,log,shared}
# If you have setup your disks already, set disk_partioning to false
# Use with caution not to delete you setup

disk_partitioning: false
disks:
  <physdev1>: <volgroupname>
  <physdev2>: <volgroupname>
  ...

logvols:
  <name1>:
    size: <size in G>
    vol: <volgroupname>
    mountpoint: <path>
  <name2>:
    ...
    

TODO
====

- improve ntpserver setup, maybe use a standard role here
